> What I do today

1. Read and learn the paper on overleaf[[Push-Pull.pdf]], and start to consider the norm of the consensus error.[[Push-pull algorithm]]
2. Read paper of **Ran Xin**.

> To-do list for tomorrow

1. What is gradient tracking method in directed graph?
2. How can we use push-sum method to improve the analysis of convergence?
3. Consider the second part in the estimate of consensus lemma, we need to use the technique in previous work.[[Previous Work.pdf]]
4. Weekly meet.
